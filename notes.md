## AWS

### AWS EC2
My public IP address is: **44.206.78.208**

Currently if I want to access my webserver I can find it at: [http://44.206.78.208/](http://44.206.78.208/)

If I want to ssh into my server I can use this command

```console
ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
```

To restrict permission on your key pair file so that they are not accessible to all users, run the chmod console command
```console 
chmod 600 yourkeypairfile.pem
```


Allocated an elastic IP address so that my server will have the same public IP address even if I stop my server. An elastic IP address will not change again until yourelease the elastic IP address. 

An elastic IP address is allocated until you release it, not until you terminate the instance. Make sure to release the elastic IP address when it is no loner needed other wise you will receive more charges. 

### When to Upgrade Your Server?
I am using a t3.nano instance. It should be enough memory and CPU to meet course requirements however if things are running slowly consider changing the instance size. 


### Route53
Domain Name: [https://triviarun.click](https://triviarun.click)

Route53 is the AWS service that handles all DNS related items. DNS automatically creates records `NS` and `SOA` records. `NS` records stands for name server and gives you authorization to place records in the DNS server. `SOA` records stands for start of authority and provides the contact information of the owner of the domain name.ht


## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

This was easy. I was careful to use the correct structural elements such as header, footer, main, nav, and form. The links between the three views work great using the `a` element.

The part I didn't like was the duplication of the header and footer code. This is messy, but it will get cleaned up when I get to React.

In order to deploy HTML files to the AWS server, use the `deployFiles.sh` file.

```console
sudo chmod +x deployFiles.sh
./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s startup
```

## CSS

This took a couple hours to get it how I wanted. It was important to make it responsive and Bootstrap helped with that. It looks great on all kinds of screen sizes.

Bootstrap seems a bit like magic. It styles things nicely, but is very opinionated. You either do, or you do not. There doesn't seem to be much in between.

I did like the navbar it made it super easy to build a responsive header.

```html
      <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary">
        <div class="container-fluid">
          <a class="navbar-brand">
            <img src="logo.svg" width="30" height="30" class="d-inline-block align-top" alt="" />
            Calmer
          </a>
          <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent">
            <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
          </button>
          <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
            <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link active" href="play.html">Play</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="about.html">About</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Logout</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
```

I also used SVG to make the icon and logo for the app. This turned out to be a piece of cake.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="100" height="100" fill="#0066aa" rx="10" ry="10" />
  <text x="50%" y="50%" dominant-baseline="central" text-anchor="middle" font-size="72" font-family="Arial" fill="white">C</text>
</svg>
```

## React Part 1: Routing

Setting up Vite and React was pretty simple. I had a bit of trouble because of conflicting CSS. This isn't as straight forward as you would find with Svelte or Vue, but I made it work in the end. If there was a ton of CSS it would be a real problem. It sure was nice to have the code structured in a more usable way.

## React Part 2: Reactivity

This was a lot of fun to see it all come together. I had to keep remembering to use React state instead of just manipulating the DOM directly.

Handling the toggling of the checkboxes was particularly interesting.

```jsx
<div className="input-group sound-button-container">
  {calmSoundTypes.map((sound, index) => (
    <div key={index} className="form-check form-switch">
      <input
        className="form-check-input"
        type="checkbox"
        value={sound}
        id={sound}
        onChange={() => togglePlay(sound)}
        checked={selectedSounds.includes(sound)}
      ></input>
      <label className="form-check-label" htmlFor={sound}>
        {sound}
      </label>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```
